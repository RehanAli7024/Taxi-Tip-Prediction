# Taxi-Tip-Prediction
Utilized the NYC Taxi Trip Records dataset from June 2019, obtained from the Taxi & Limousine Commission
(TLC), City of New York. This dataset included a detailed information about taxi trips and tip amounts in New York City.
Conducted thorough data preprocessing using Scikit-Learn to ensure data readiness for model training and testing.
Implemented a Decision Tree Regressor model using both Scikit-Learn and Snap ML Python APIs for predictions.
Evaluated the trained Decision Tree Regressor models to assess their predictive performance. Metrics such as
Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared were used to measure model accuracy and generalization capability.
